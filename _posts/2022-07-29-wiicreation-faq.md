Hello! I have received a lot of questions on my Wiicreation videos
and I have created this post to answer them. If you have a question
that's not on this post, feel free to post your question in the
comments of this post and I will add it to the list.

**Where can I get Wiicreation?**<br />
At the moment you can't get it.

**When will it be released?**<br />
Not any time soon.

**Is this an app launcher?**<br />
I didn't intend for it to be one but I could make it one!

**Does this run WADs (or similar formats)?**<br />
No. It is not an emulator. It runs a proprietary WCA format.

**Is this still continued?**<br />
At the time of writing this, no. I am thinking of working on it again
when I have time.

**What are you going to do with it?**<br />
I want to make it it's own platform so it can run community made games
and applications.

**Will you be able to play games made by me on it?**<br />
I might port my games over to Wiicreation at some point. They might
even be launch titles!
