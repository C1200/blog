Hello all!

All @UltimateMedia staff is now out of office for the Christmas holidays. They are now on **emergency only** standby for code that needs immediate fixing.

The emergency contact is: <umemergency@c1200.tk>

@C1200 also has his Discord direct messages on in the servers:

- Ultimate Media's Discord [[link](https://discord.gg/u4Tsf3N)]

- The Rodway's Discord [[link](https://discord.gg/G5W89sF)]

See you on the 3rd of January 2020!

Have a safe and happy holidays!<br>
Ultimate Media
